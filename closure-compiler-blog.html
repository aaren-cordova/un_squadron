Playing with the Closure Compiler
	// TODO - Elevator pitch

	Rules:
		Rule #1 :
			The first rule of the Closure Compiler, code must run without the closure compiler.

		Rule #2 :
			The second rule of the Closure Compiler, code must run without the closure compiler!
	
		Rule #3 :
			Code must be EcmaScript 3* compliant

			*1 - Can be set to ES4, ES5 or ES6 though that would not ensure browser compatibility before 2009

	Purpose of the compiler:
		- Increase efficiency through minification
			[ Move to section ]
			HTTP Requests - Reduces the number of HTTP requests by concatinating JS files together
			Byte size - Lowers the total number of bytes transfered by removing whitespace, renaming functions, properties, inlining JS and eliminating unreachable code.
			GZip size - Optimizations are targeted towards the final gzip size (not bytes), though it will often win in both areas when compared to other compilers.

		- Obfuscation
			[Move to section]
			Reversibility
				Though no JavaScript is beyond reversibility, obfuscation deters 99.99% of thieves trying to crack it.
				Software is expensive to develop, tedious to QA and devastating when stolen.
				Do you write your pass-code on the back of the phone?
				Ever see a computer hardware company keep it's 
				Expose a multi-million dollar software companies ... software?
				Either obfuscate all of your JavaScript or mark it as free (as in beer) for all.
			[Move to section]
			Security
				Because the original source structure is not maintained after minification, there is a level of added security that keeps others from getting their hands on the entire codebase as well.

		- Code checks during compilation
			[ Move to Section]
			Linting
				Linting is the process of removing suspicious or non-portable constructs.  
				Similar to JS lint [link], the compiler utilizes a separate tool called the closure linter [link].  
				A deep dive into the linter is beyond the scope of this post, but a brief overview includes checks for the following:
					- EcmaScript compliant syntax (default set to ES3)
					- Common JavaScript pitfalls (trailing commas, hasOwnProptery not used in for in loops, missing semicolons, ect.)
					- Use of undeclared vars (spelling errors)
					- Follows a coding style guide [optional]

			[ Move to Section]
			Data Type Checking
				Data type checking is not linting!  As the name implies, a value supplied is the correct data type (classification) and the methods / properties used on that data type exsist are used properly.  Because  
				[Move to section or delete]
				JavaScript does not natively support features we've come to know:
					Access control keywords: public, private, protected, final
					Mutation control keywords: constant 
					Implicit data type keywords: interface, implements
					Explicit data type keywords: class, extends
					Inheritance keywords: override, super
					Package statements: package, import, export
					Required vs Optional parameters
				To get around this, JavaDocs can be used to enforce the rules and regulations of some of the missing keywords DURING COMPILATION.
				It CANNOT change the language itself, and DOES NOT add additional JavaScript in an attempt to fix the language @see rule #1.
				
				[collapse]
				So for features such as import/export/package you can either use the methods provided by the google closure library:
					Import: 
						{code}
							goog.require('dmd.ui.Component');
						{code}
						[http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/local_closure_goog_base.js.source.html#line428]

					Export: 
						{code}
							goog.provide('dmd.ui.TabComponent');
						{code}
						[http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/local_closure_goog_base.js.source.html#line226]
					
					Package:
						{code}
							goog.scope(function(){/* YOUR PACKAGE HERE*/});
						{code}
						[http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/local_closure_goog_base.js.source.html#line1686]
					
					Class: 
						{code}
							goog.inherits();
						{code}
						[http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/local_closure_goog_base.js.source.html#line1686]
				
				or write your own
					Import:
					{code}
						if(!dmd.loadedModules_['dmd.ui.Component']){
							throw new Error('Module dmd.ui.Component not yet loaded.')
						}
						var Component = dmd.ui.Component;
					{code}

					Export:
						{code}
							var dmd = dmd || {};
							dmd.ui = dmd.ui || {};
							dmd.ui.TabComponent = function(){/*...*/};
						{code}

				
					Inherits:
						[See why this works | http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14564155/javascript-prototypal-inheritance-descendants-override-each-other/14576273]
					{code}
						function inherits(childClass, parentClass){
							var Temp = function(){};
							Temp.prototype = parentClass.prototype;
							childClass.prototype = new Temp();
							childClass.prototype.constructor = childClass.prototype;
						}
					{code}
				This gives the developer an added incentive to document their code as well as create the interface  
				The compiler follows path of execution through the prototype chain and validates the following:
					The property exists on a given object
					The function was called with the correct number of arguments
					The all parameters are the correct data type (boolean, string, number, Array, Object, SomeCustomClass, IAnyMadeUpInterface ...)
					Private methods are not used outside of the file
					Overridden methods are explicitly marked for override
					That a class adheres to a given interface
	How the closure compiler is different
		Written in Python / Java
		Extensible
		Open Source
		[Move to section]
		Multiple compilation modes
			Level 0 - Development / Un-compiled 
				Auto generates a dependency file to be used inline with HTML.
				This allows you to dynamically load the JS files in the proper build order without having to run it though the compiler each and every time or manually maintain a build order list.
				@see deps writer.

			Level 1 - Script
				The fully concatenated unminified file - <a href="http://stevesouders.com/hpws/rule-min-http.php">Making fewer HTTP Requests</a>

			Level 2 - Whitespace
				Removes unnecessary whitespace characters along with superfluous braces and semicolons.

			Level 3 - Simple
				Renames variables (and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)">closures</a>) within functions to shorter names.
				Removal of dead or unreachable code (@see defined vars)

			Level 4 - Advance
				The crown jewel of the compiler, the size of the file is not relative to total size of the included files, but the size of the functions in use.
				Given a list of files and the insertion points, the closure compiler will scan the execution path and include only functions / inlined scripts that will be used or are explicitly exported.
				@see metrics

			The Lost Level - Debug
				If you've ever dealt with minified code, then at some point in your career you may have seen something like the following:
					Parse error. Semi-colon expected at line 1 character 4511984

			Level Editor - List

		Deps writer
			Dependency grid is automatically generated for both compiled and uncompiled modes

		Validation
			Type checking at build time, not run time
			Design by Interface
			Pseudo private vars
			Validate method calls
		Minification
			Multiple compilation modes to choose from
			Not just bytes, optimized for GZip size
			Support for minified code to still maintain a public API
			In lined methods
			Removal of dead or unused code
			Renaming of all variables (Not just closure based vars)

		Frequently asked questions:
			Do I (really) have to use JavaDocs for the compiler to work?
				No you don't, but you should.
				You get better type checking at compile time, 
				You should be documenting your code anyway.
			Is the closure library required to run the closure compiler?
				No. The compiler and the library we're written to work independently of one another.
				That being said, the closure library is written with the compiler in mind.
				That means more type annotations, more data type checks, and more compression.
			Does it support features beyond EcmaScript 4?
				--language=ECMASCRIPT5_STRICT
				That being said, you probably don't want to use the latest and greatest feature if it's not widely supported (unless you control the JavaScript that's installed).
				I'll take that back when I see wide spread use of the class keyword in the client side code in production.
			Is it compatible with third party libraries
				Extern files prevent rewrites of external code while allowing type checking.
			Global vars renamed, rending library useless
				Exports
			Fully qualified names are slower to access
				All fully qualified names are renamed to one level deep.
